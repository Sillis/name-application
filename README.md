## Name Application
<br>
Proof of competence CRA app with some stylings.

CountAmount is borked and "grand total of individuals" should be "grand total of [number of] individuals".

NameDisplay reads names.json and spits out an alphabetisized list of names. Flip the angle brackets to change ascending-descending. Could probably do a onClick-function that flips them.

AmountDisplay reads names.json and spits out the list ordered by popularity, based on <code>names.amount</code>. If you're the type of person who prefers big numbers on the bottom and small ones on top, you can flip the angle brackets on this one too.
